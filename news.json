This is enforced by Ofcom under the Online Safety Act.<br><br>⚠️ <b><u>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</u></b><br><b>GrindrPlus will NOT help you get around this verification by any means</b>. Previously, you could force the feature flag to be disabled because it wasn't mandatory by law yet, Grindr was just testing things out.<br><br>Now that it's legally required, any code that interferes with age verification has been completely removed because this project will not help anyone break the law or create legal issues.<br><br><b><u>A NEW RULE WILL BE ADDED</u></b> to this group strictly prohibiting any discussions, questions, or requests related to bypassing age verification requirements. Violations will result in <b><u>IMMEDIATE REMOVAL FROM THE GROUP</u></b>.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> Even if someone managed to bypass the client-side verification, Grindr's servers will not allow you to continue without proper age verification completion so don't waste your time.<br><br>❓<b><u>WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:</u></b><br>If you encounter the age verification screen, GrindrPlus will show a dialog preventing you from continuing and explaining the legal requirements <b>(this will happen from now on in new versions).</b><br><br><b>If you use LSPosed, just disable the module temporarily, complete the verification process in the official app, then enable it back.</b><br><br>If <b><u>YOU ARE NOT USING LSPOSED</u></b>, you must <b><u>UNINSTALL GRINDRPLUS</u></b> completely and <b><u>USE THE OFFICIAL GRINDR APP TO COMPLETE THE VERIFICATION PROCESS</u></b> first.
